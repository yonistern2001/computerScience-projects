Document Store and Search Engine


Developed the backend for a search engine. Implemented custom data structures to allow for quick storage of documents and retrieval of search results. Created a trie to support efficient keyword-based document searching. Implemented caching strategy which utilized Gson to move documents to disk in order to minimize memory consumption. Added support for undo's (undo's the most recently added Document by setting it to what was previously stored at that URI) which was implemented using a stack.
