Document Store and Search Engine

Developed the backend for a search engine. Implemented many data structures to allow for effective storage of information along with the ability to quickly return search results. Used a trie to allow user to search for documents containing a specified keyword. Used JSON to allow for files to be moved to disk when the set memory limit was overrun. Added support for undo's (undo's the last added Document by setting it to what was previously stored at that URI) which was implemented using a stack.
